# Orchestrator Definition
Ralph sent an email with [Orchestrator Definition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZtYFcDpkfOKJbFhkw-XPuD1eix0ovXSOe3cyEQivQQ/edit) attached.  Note the link is the actual attached google doc.  These are my response notes.

The question being asked was:
How does RansomShield define “network” to select which devices should be self-healed?

The questions before seemed to seek:
What is the User interface mechanisim Hacker Strike should implement to regulate RansonShield App Process Blocker within an associated user group.

Notes:
I do like the new diagram, and if you notice the labels... it is very 'Ralph'.  The diagram does not show up in the above link, but the pdf attached to the email:
