# Hacker Strike User Tutorials
I intend to combine the efforts of technical publications, quality assurance, client monitoring and regression testing into the automated CI/CD release process.

## Client Domain User accounts

1. horseoff.com
    - hsadmin
    - hsuser
    - hstest
2. 2cld.net
    - cldadmin
    - clduser
    - cldtest

## Testing
On a Microsoft Surface an hsadmin user was created.  The intent is to model a non-domain hsadmin user on a restricted client. The hsadmin user will use the google web browser and a google user account to sign up for a test account at [https://hackerstrike.com/](https://hackerstrike.com/)

1. Login to device using local hsadmin user account.
2. Turn on OBS and start recording
3. Login to hsadmin@horseoff.com in the google browser.
4. Go to [http://hs.2cld.net/docs/tutorials/](http://hs.2cld.net/docs/tutorials/) to see this document.
5. Go to [https://hackerstrike.com/](https://hackerstrike.com/) and walk through a signup.
6. keep documenting steps
